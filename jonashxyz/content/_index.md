# Welcome to my personal website/tech blog
Hi. I'm Jonas from Norway. I'm an aspiring DevOps/backend/cloud native engineer and avid learner.

Here's some of the stuff I enjoy: Linux ([arch](https://archlinux.org/) btw), [NixOS](https://nixos.org/), [vim/neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim), [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux), [open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source), [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), programming, tinkering, computer science, technology, gadgets, CLI/TUI tools, automation, productivity, books, movies, nature, science, people, history and culture.
