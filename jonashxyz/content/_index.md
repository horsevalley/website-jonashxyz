# Welcome to my personal website/tech blog
Hi. I'm Jonas from Norway. I'm an aspiring DevOps/backend/cloud native engineer and avid learner.

Here's some of the stuff I enjoy: Linux ([arch](https://archlinux.org/) btw), vim/neovim, tmux, open source, programming, tinkering, computer science, technology, gadgets, CLI/TUI tools, automation, productivity, books, movies, nature, science, people, history and culture.
