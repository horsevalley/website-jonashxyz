Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) is more efficient than the older classful network design for several key reasons;

## 1. Flexible Subnetting and Address Allocation

### Classful Network Design:

- IP addresses were divided into fixed classes (A, B, C, D, E).
- Class A: 16 million addresses (8-bit network prefix).
- Class B: 65,536 addresses (16-bit network prefix).
- Class C: 256 addresses (24-bit network prefix).
- This fixed structure often led to significant wastage of IP addresses. For example, a network needing 300 addresses would require a Class B allocation, wasting most of the 65,536 addresses.

### CIDR:

- Allows for arbitrary-length network prefixes, enabling more precise allocation of IP addresses.
- Example: A CIDR block like 192.168.0.0/22 can allocate 1,024 addresses (covering 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.3.255), which is more efficient than allocating a larger block unnecessarily.
- This flexibility reduces wastage and allows for better utilization of IP address space.

## 2. Simplified Routing and Reduced Routing Table Size

### Classful Network Design

- Each network class required its entry in routing tables.
- The rigid class boundaries could lead to numerous routing table entries, especially with many small networks.

### CIDR

- Enables route aggregation (supernetting), which combines multiple IP address ranges into a single routing table entry.
- Example: Multiple networks like 192.168.0.0/24, 192.168.1.0/24, 192.168.2.0/24, and 192.168.3.0/24 can be aggregated into a single CIDR block 192.168.0.0/22.
- This reduces the number of entries in routing tables, leading to faster and more efficient routing.

## 3. Improved Internet Scalability

### Classful Network Design

- The rapid growth of the Internet led to the exhaustion of available Class B and C addresses.
- The class-based allocation system struggled to keep up with the expanding number of networks.

### CIDR

- Delays IPv4 address exhaustion by allowing more granular allocation of address space.
- Supports hierarchical IP address allocation, which improves the scalability of the global routing system.
- Internet Service Providers (ISPs) can allocate IP addresses more efficiently, reducing the need for frequent renumbering and reallocation.

## 4. Enhanced Network Design Flexibility

### Classful Network Design

- Networks were constrained to predefined sizes, making it difficult to design networks that matched organizational needs precisely.
- Limited flexibility in managing and optimizing network resources.

### CIDR

- Provides the ability to create subnets and supernets tailored to specific requirements.
- Organizations can design networks that closely match their size and growth expectations, optimizing resource usage and management.

## Summary of Efficiency Gains

- Address Utilization: CIDR reduces IP address wastage by allowing precise subnetting.
- Routing Efficiency: CIDR minimizes routing table size through route aggregation, enhancing routing performance.
- Scalability: CIDR supports the growth of the Internet by enabling more efficient use of the IPv4 address space.
- Flexibility: CIDR offers greater flexibility in network design, accommodating diverse organizational needs.

## Practical Example

Imagine a company needing IP addresses for 500 hosts. Under the classful system, they would have to use a Class B network (/16), which provides 65,536 addresses, wasting a vast majority. With CIDR, they can allocate a 23-bit network prefix (e.g., 192.168.0.0/23), providing 512 addresses, which is a much more efficient use of IP space.

By adopting CIDR, the efficiency of IP address allocation and routing is significantly improved, making it a preferred choice for modern networking.
