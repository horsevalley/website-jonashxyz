title: Yazi - a Blazing Fast Terminal File Manager written in Rust
---

I've been using this terminal file manager for a few weeks now, and I must say; I absolutely love it!
It's written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), so all I/O operations are asynchronous, which means CPU tasks are spread across multiple threads, utilizing available resources.
And the best part; it has vim keybindings!

Not convinced yet? Check out the [GitHub page](https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi), and scroll down a bit until you reach "example.mp4". You'll see a video that demonstrates some of its cool features.

You can check out other nice features [here](https://yazi-rs.github.io/features/), like scrollable preview, bulk rename and integration with tools like [fd](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd), [rg](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep), [ueberzugpp](https://github.com/jstkdng/ueberzugpp) and more.
