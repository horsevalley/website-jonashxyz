## Unshackle Your Digital Life
1. Get a Google Pixel phone, so you can install [GrapheneOS](https://grapheneos.org/). I recommend Google Pixel 6a. Very cheap and very good.
   - Get rid of all the apps you don't need 
2. Sync your data with [SyncThing](https://syncthing.net/)
3. Create your own [NextCloud](https://landchad.net/nextcloud/) server
4. Use [VimWiki](https://github.com/vimwiki/vimwiki)/[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) + vim/[neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) to take notes in [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/), and take full ownership over your own data
5. Use [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) on your personal computer(s)
6. Use [pass](https://www.passwordstore.org/) to store your accounts/passwords
7. Don't let [proprietary software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_software) take your money and own YOUR data
8. Never look back
